# Pacman

A pacman game for Data Structure and Algorithm Project
Various ghosts Ele, Meep, Timid, Helper chase Pacman with the power of path finding algorithms like **Depth First Search**, **Breadth First Search** and **A Star**.
Can you dodge all of them and collect all the points ?

**Meep**: Isn't the brightest, will just find a path regardless if it is the shortest, but you bet he is gonna chase you

**Ele**: Calm And Collected, Makes Calculated Decisions using AStar

**Timid**: A smart fellow, but gets easily flustered.

**Helper**: Cuts off the path.
